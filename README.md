# Solving-Regression-Problem-using-ANN

A regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value, such as “salary” or “weight”. Many different models can be used, the simplest is the linear regression. It tries to fit data with the best hyper-plane which goes through the points.


1. ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

The term "Artificial neural network" refers to a biologically inspired sub-field of artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. An Artificial neural network is usually a computational network based on biological neural networks that construct the structure of the human brain. Similar to a human brain has neurons interconnected to each other, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are linked to each other in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes.

Artificial Neural Network primarily consists of three layers:

a)Input Layer:- As the name suggests, it accepts inputs in several different formats provided by the programmer.

b)Hidden Layer:- The hidden layer presents in-between input and output layers. It performs all the calculations to find hidden features and patterns.

c)Output Layer:- The input goes through a series of transformations using the hidden layer, which finally results in output that is conveyed using this layer.


2. REGRESSION

Regression is a supervised machine learning technique which is used to predict continuous values. The ultimate goal of the regression algorithm is to plot a best-fit line or a curve between the data. The three main metrics that are used for evaluating the trained regression model are variance, bias and error. If the variance is high, it leads to overfitting and when the bias is high, it leads to underfitting.
